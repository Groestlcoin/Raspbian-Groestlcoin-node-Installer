# Raspbian-Groestlnote-Installer
this is the installer for the Raspberry Pi groestlcoin node. It is meant for raspbian, and might brick your computer.


# What does this script do?
It pulls all the relevant files, installs groestlcoind, and then puts two scripts that are meant to run and make sure that groestlcoind is up.

# why do I need it?
Well, I tried to tweak the groestlcoind settings here to run on Raspberry Pi Model B (the one with 512MB ram). I found a few people who said that they can run it on RPi2, but the guides for Model B did not work. I had to format, reformat and reformat again.

# Will this work?
On RPi B v2 it works, i couldn't make it happen on RPi1.

# License?
This is BSD.
