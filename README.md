# Raspbian-Bitnote-Installer
this is the installer for the Raspberry Pi bitcoin node. It is meant for raspbian, and might brick your computer.


# What does this script do?
It pulls all the relevant files, installs bitcoind, and then puts two scripts that are meant to run and make sure that bitcoind is up. 

# why do I need it?
Well, I tried to tweak the bitcoind settings here to run on Raspberry Pi Model B (the one with 512MB ram). I found a few people who said that they can run it on RPi2, but the guides for Model B did not work. I had to format, reformat and reformat again.

# Will this work?
Hoepfully. I'm currently syncing. I'm in a better stage from the last kernel panic and "oops" that I got.

# License?
This is BSD.
